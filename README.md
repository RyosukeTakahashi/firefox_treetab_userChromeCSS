# treetab_userChromeCSS
userChrome.css setting for hiding the tabbar and titlebar and the close/hide/maximize buttons.

# My environment.

- Firefox 59.0.1 (Aimed for Firefox Quantum(Firefox 57+).)
- Tree style tab 2.4.17 installed

https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/

# Where to put userChrome.css

Type `about:support` in the urlbar and access Trouble shooting information.
Look for `Profile Folder` in the table and open it with Finder/Exploler or something.
Make a folder name `chrome` and put userChrome.css in it.

Look the following link for more explanation.

# What it does.

- Show the tab on left side. (By the Tree Style Tab addon.)
- Hide the title/tabbar including the hide/maximize/close buttons. (Using userChrome.css)
  - Since there is no need to show tab at both left and top.

It would make a very minimal clean interface.
